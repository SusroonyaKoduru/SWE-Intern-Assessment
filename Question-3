To provide an easy solution for the coaching staff to request or acquire the output themselves, you can consider the following:

a. Develop a simple web-based interface where the coaching staff can upload their game data file and select the specific analysis 
they want to perform (e.g., checking boundary, extracting weapon classes, analyzing strategies, generating heatmaps). 
The interface should allow them to input any required parameters (such as boundary coordinates) and display the results in a user-friendly format.

b. Implement a backend server that handles the file upload, performs the requested analysis using the ProcessGameState class, and generates the output. 
The server can store the analyzed data and results in a database for easy retrieval by the coaching staff. 
The frontend interface can then communicate with the backend server using APIs to request the analysis and display the results to the coaching staff.

By implementing a web-based interface and a backend server, the coaching staff can access the analysis results without requiring technical knowledge or running the code themselves.
They can simply upload their game data file, select the desired analysis, and view the output through the user interface. 
This solution can be implemented within a week's time frame with the right development resources and expertise.
